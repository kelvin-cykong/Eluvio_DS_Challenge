## Eluvio Data Science Challenge
This is the GitHub repo of my submission to Eluvio Data Science Open Challenge

My goal is to build an algorithm to classify whether the News is popular (Number of Up Votes) based on the title, and predict future News title's popularity. 

### Algorithms tested:
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Network
  - Built a Simple Neural Network with 1 hidden layer, two dropouts to reduce overfitting.
  - Normalization of values for better result.
